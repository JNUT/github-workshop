# Github-Workshop
This is a github repo I'm gonna be using to introduce people to git/github.

## How it works

I'll be creating a text file for each git/github introductory workshop. 
Participants will then have to get their names in that file.

## Guide

Read this [Github Guide](https://help.github.com) and figure it out yourself!
(Okay, I might get around to making a friendlier guide ehre sometime.)
